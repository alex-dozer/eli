# Start of a journey

I think I got as far as I can in project planning right now. I've come to feel... out of depth? I'm out of my depth. But, this is a terrific place to be. Everything is magical now.

There needs to be important architectural decisions made which I have no real fundamental understanding of tradeoffs. So, I gotta get my head in the books. Luckily, I've hoarded a lot of Mike X Cohen Udemy courses. I got a couple signal processing courses, an Fourier Transform course, stats course, some others. My "I will totally take this" mentality paid off... Finally....

I'm going to take the next month and a half, maybe a bit longer and just get into a place where I'm not so out of depth. This project is a place to learn. And it's a lot different than standard software projects I've done. Which is terrific.

The first iteration of the design repo is up on my github. There it will sit in stasis for a bit while I get competent enough to continue planning it.
