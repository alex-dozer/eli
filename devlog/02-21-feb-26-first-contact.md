# First SDR Contact

My rtl-sdr blog v4 came today. So I had to try it out, and it was difficult. But, it was really, really cool.

I could kinda get an FM station on CubicSDR. I must have played with it for a few hours. As long as I could tolerate static really. I just went through all the settings. Seeing the spikes, seeing the waterfall. It was pretty exhilarating. Interacting with the physical world gave me joy in a real specific way that I don't get from software.

Honestly, I hadn't gotten that joy since I was on a project to build a portable blood pressure device. I rewrote the code to run the blood pressure machine, I was a total junior. The senior guy on the project called me to his desk and said "press this button". I did, and then the machine sprang to life. He looked at me and said "you wrote that". The feeling was incredible. Working with the sdr gave me the same feeling. This was also the same project I struggled through writing an FFT. But, that was over a decade ago. I ended up focusing largely on cybersecurity tooling. I got a fascination with building and studying malware, red team tooling, and OSINT tooling for a long time. I ramble...

I guess... I haven't worked with something so probabilistic in a long time. I got a better understanding of how out of my depth I was. I feel its wonderful though. Seeing and interacting with the physical world is such a thrill. I could easily see myself getting neck deep into Eli. So much to learn, so many mysteries to figure out. I was honestly surprised with how difficult it is to get an FM signal to come through clear.

I bought two books: **The Hobbyist's Guide to the RTL-SDR** and **Practical SDR**. I very much look forward to them being delivered. The ARRL Handbook I have turned out to be the antenna edition, which still has good stuff, but I guess more limited?

I tried two dipole antennas. I traipsed around my house trying a lot of places to put the antenna hoping my dog Dozer didn't get the itch to run through the wire. I ended up using **dump1090** and saw the aircraft communication show up, which was way cool.

Waiting on the Raspberry Pi. 3D printing the enclosure will be awesome too.

I can see this being a long term passion project. I roll slow downhill so incredible/speedy progress is unlikely. But, it's given me a real needed sense of wonder I haven't had in a while. Playing with the SDR reminded me why I wanted to build Eli in the first place: not to process signals, but to understand the invisible world that’s been humming around me the whole time.
